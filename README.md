Explanation

DOMContentLoaded Event: Ensures the JavaScript runs after the HTML content is fully loaded.

Add to Cart Button Event Listener: When an "Add to Cart" button is clicked, the script gets the product's name from the h2 element and shows an alert message.

Further Development: You can extend this script to handle cart updates, saving to local storage, or interacting with a server. This is a basic function of an "Add to Cart" button.

How to Use:

Create Files: Make three files: index.html, style.css, and script.js.

Copy Code: Copy the HTML into index.html, the CSS into style.css, and the JavaScript into script.js.

Add Product Images: Put your product images in the same directory as the HTML file (or adjust image paths in the HTML).

Open in Browser: Open index.html in your web browser to view the e-commerce site.

Improvements & Extensions:

Advanced Cart: Implement a more functional cart using local storage or server-side handling.

Product Filtering: Add search or filter options.

User Accounts: Include registration/login functionality.

Payment Integration: Integrate a payment gateway.

Animations: Add some transitions and animations for better user experience.

Error Handling: Implement error messages and validation.
